# Beijing-Real-Estate
In this project I've done some practical analysis on Beijing's real estate dataset. This project contains five phases. In the first three phases, I applied some preprocessing approaches 
to clean the dataset. At first, we are dealing with missing values which should be filled by the best alternative. Next, we'll jump to correct format and outliers phase. In this phase we
should correct the format of data and remove outliers. After that, in phase three, we'll use some features to generate a new effective features which will be used in our analysis.
Finally, in phases four and five, we'll do some time series anaysis and draw some plots to get better comprehension about our previous phases results.
